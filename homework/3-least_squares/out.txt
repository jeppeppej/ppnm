This gives the function: f(x) = 143.208*exp(-0.172713*x)

Covariance matrix S
 0.0010156 -0.0001172 
-0.0001172  0.0000195 

This gives a relative activity @ time 0: a = 143.208 +- 4.56388
And gamma = 0.172713 +- 0.00441942
Which gives a half-life of (4.01329 +- 0.102693) d
Half-life for 224Ra = 3.63 d
Which is not terribly far away from our fitted value.
However it still outside the estimated uncertainty.
