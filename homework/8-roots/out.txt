Task A and B of roots.
The simple function x^3 is used for debuggin.
Its root = 3.47822e-05 which is within the tolerance being     0.0001

On to the Rosenbrock function. Applying the algoritm to its gradient returns
[         1] 
[         1] 
within the tolerance      0.001
On to task B...
The root of M(epsilon) is found via the algoritm to: 
[ -0.500315] 
within tolerance      0.001. The expected value is -1/2, so the rootfinding seems to be working.
